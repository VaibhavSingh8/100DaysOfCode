# 100DaysOfCode #100DaysOfCodeLW3
This repository is made to serve as a tracker of my work which I will be doing in the 100DaysOfCode challenge.  

Starting 9 Jan 2023, I will be coding for 100 days for minimum of 1 hour as apart of this challenge.

Goals:

1. Get better at CSS and build projects.
2. Build projects to practice basic JS with HTML and CSS.
3. Learn React and build projects.

Overall it is all focused on learning Frontend development.
